## Freedom and Equality

In these turbulent times, ideas of living freely as equals in our society are constantly at the edge
of our awareness. Both ideas can be vague and hard to define. Still, in this issue, I jump into the
deep end at the risk of drowning. I beg a little leeway this morning.

It's a time when a generation of Indians seeks to rebuild the nation in the image of wealthy American
society where everyone roams free to chase the grand American dream. That shimmering oasis though,
appears to disappear the closer we examine it. The American Dream is disintegrating for all but a few.

In a provactive piece titled "[America is Turning into a Developing Nation](http://l.goodbits.io/l/esn573d7)"
we see a picture of a split nation -- a 20% high-wage Finance, Technology and Electronics sector and
a 80% low-wage insecure job sector -- creating a dual economy where

> much of the low-wage sector has little influence over public policy. _Check_.

> The high-income sector keeps wages down in the other sector to provide cheap labor for its businesses. _Check_.

> Social control is used to keep the low-wage sector from challenging the policies favored by the high-income sector. _Check_.

> Mass incarceration - _Check_.

> The primary goal of the richest members of the high-income sector is to lower taxes. _Check_.

> Social and economic mobility is low. _Check_.

What does this foretell about the kind of future lying ahead? Our society is only just setting out
on its technological reinvention. Technologists pride themselves in being apolitical and above the
messiness of morality, creating neither good nor bad, empowering the free and unrestricted use of
technology. The disturbing trend though, is of technology and capital uniting to create a very
skewed global society powered by surveillance capitalism.

Behind the veneer of innovative disruption, new monopolies rise up and chip away at the financial
foundation of large sections of the population. Whether its Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Uber
-- uncountable content creators, journalists, retailers and cab drivers amongst others have lost
their livelihoods thanks to the tides of technology. This does not even begin to count those
affected by robotics in manufacturing and the enourmously disruptive effects of artificial
intelligence predicted over the next ten years. These newly voiceless forever teeter on the brink of
collapse -- always in fear of that killing blow which flings them into the hellfires of poverty,
humiliation and exploitation.

How do conscientious, well-intentioned technologists craft a role for themselves where their skills
and talents create equitable outcomes? What forms of technology do societies and communities adopt
to ensure equitable access to opportunity and communal resources? How do we straighten out the
intent of freedom with the inequality it creates?

The common view holds that freedom and equality are opposites. If people are free, they will be
free to be unequal. If they are legislated to be eqaul, they cannot be free. Forcing equality
removes drive and ambition ending in stagnation. This framing pits one idea against the other and
sets the stage for left vs right politics. Like boxers in a prize-fight, they slug it out in a
three-ring media circus that turns policy-making into spectacle. The end result is we remain trapped
within this framework of thought we exist in. Some though, are beginning to ask probing questions.

We are indeed free to hustle and snatch larger shares of the resources. Free like prisoners hustling
for influence with their guards in exchange for building the prison walls ever higher. This freedom
on display is nothing but smoke and mirrors. Freedom is not realised by not having any obstacles in
our way. Freedom is not the ability to choose between two equally depressing outcomes -- to exploit
or be exploited. And neither is freedom an abandonment of rule and order to embrace chaos and
anarchy.

Real freedom and liberty lies inside each one of us. True freedom allows you to make real in the
world the stuff kept hidden at the deepest core of your being. You can only truly be free when fear
is set aside. When your most glorious inner being expresses itself fully in creation, feeling,
loving.

For this, the first need is to know the inner self. Then action can flow from an alignment with the
self. The difficulty moves from making freedom and equality coexist to knowing one's self and
creating a society who's objectives are not shameful for the self. This then can be a true compass
for the technologist with a conscience.
