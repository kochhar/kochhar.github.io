title: Two Predictions

It's time I put some thoughts together and made some predictions. Despite all the hype angle of AI,
the  conversations have brought to light some interesting questions. First, how soon will real
artificial intelligence come to be? Will it be a slow growth or a rapid rise? And how will our
societies adapt?

My first prediction is that the kind of generalised aritficial intelligence we think about when
we consider self-awareness and rapid growth will take a while. It's far more likely we'll initially
have a large number of specialised systems which spread across domains slowly.

My second prediction is that as a society we will tend to resist and restrain these developments
to the extent that a new form of sovreignity will emerge from it. I don't have a strong grasp yet
of what shape it would take. Perhaps regulators will attempt to lock down what Google, Amazon,
Apple, Facebook, AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, et al. can do. In return these companies establish a new
nation(??) and award digital residence to people across the world. A possible first corporate
state. Hypothetical.

A new war between technology and politics is inevitable. Allow me to to backtrack a bit.
Humans have been held together by the bonds of three forces. Money, Religion & Power. Money is a
miracle, creating value seemingly out of nothing. Religion answers the call of mystery. And power
fills our need for authority. This trifecta allows us to continue leading peaceful lives all
knowing that life itself has no ultimate purpose except self-preservation.

Science came to dominate commerce quickly. Technology became the comepetitive advantage of
businesses since the first wheels and levers. Science became the miracle worker, business the money
earner. Science then fought a bloody, pitched battle against religion for the throne of mystery.
Bloody, bruised and battered they shared the spoils with religion providing miracles for the world's
poorest.

Technology now has but one foe left to defeat to complete the trifecta and become a supreme god.
Perhpas then we may reach unity. The unifying principle. There is a generation of technologists and
entreprenurs at work on this. Building replacements. Building alternatives. It's may appear hard to
find them, but they're there. Hiding in plain sight. Building their new ecosystem, their digitopia.
With solar powered batteries sending rockets into space. With digital currency protected by
unbreakable encryption. With decentralised distributed architecttures for tracking everything,
shared ledgers to note and track every movement and every interaction.

These petabytes of logs, proprietary to the companies providing the future digital infrastructure,
will cover the minutiae of billions of peoples lives. It'll be essential data needed to unlock more
generalised intelligence.

With sovreignity, national identity and money taken from the purview of the state the power of
governments over their populations will weaken. Till the technologists don't have a general
intelligence the balance of power lies with the state preventing war. Once that line is breached?
Why don't you tell me what you think.
